# FourCore Custom Cursor

FourCore Custom Cursor is a Shopify app that lets merchants apply lightweight, CSS-based custom cursors to their storefronts. It uses theme app embeds and native CSS cursors for minimal impact on page speed.

## Features

- Preset cursor gallery with hover variants
- Saved cursor library
- Upload your own cursor URLs (PNG recommended)
- Separate size controls for default and hover cursors
- Custom colors for built-in cursors (default + hover)
- Disable cursors on mobile

## Installation

1. Install the app from the Shopify App Store.
2. In Online Store > Themes, open the theme editor.
3. Enable the "FourCore Custom Cursor" app embed.
4. Open the app to choose a cursor and sizes.
5. Click "Save & Publish".

## Custom cursors

- Use transparent PNGs.
- Recommended size range: 24 to 64 px.
- Hover cursors should be visually distinct from default cursors.

## Notes

- Cursor size on the storefront uses the actual image size.
- For best results, match cursor size to the image you upload.
- Color controls apply to built-in cursor presets only.

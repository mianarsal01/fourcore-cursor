# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-01-20

FourCore Cursor ("the App") helps merchants add custom cursors to their storefronts. This policy describes how we handle data when you use the App.

## Data we access

The App accesses only the data required to configure and apply cursor settings to your storefront:

- App installation metadata
- Cursor settings you choose (default cursor, hover cursor, sizes, and mobile toggle)

We do not access orders, customers, products, or payment information.

## Data we store

We store cursor configuration settings to persist your choices between sessions. We do not store personal customer data.

## Data sharing

We do not sell or share your data with third parties.

## Data retention

Settings are stored while the App is installed. When you uninstall the App, the stored settings are removed.

## Contact
